class Car:
    """ Objectice is to create a Car class which contains the owner's name, miles to drive and fuel required for driving.
    Initally, the car has no fuel therefore it needs to be refilled.
    Once refilled, the car can drive upto the required miles.
    In case, there is not enough fuel to complete the miles, an indication will appear saying how much more is needed to be refilled.

    The car can also refill from another car in case of an emergency if there is no petrol pump.
